## ✨ Overview

Welcome to the **MCA-NETWORK-LAB** repository! This project documents my journey through the Network Lab course as part of the MCA program. Here, you'll find a variety of shell scripts and network programming assignments, each organized by date. The scripts demonstrate practical use cases and fundamental concepts in Linux shell scripting and network operations.

## ⚡ How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nihalshx/MCA-NETWORK-LAB.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to a folder:**
   Each folder contains scripts for a specific lab session. Open the folder to view and run the scripts.
3. **Run a script:**
   Most scripts are Bash scripts. You can run them using:
   ```bash
   bash scriptname.sh
   ```
   or make them executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x scriptname.sh
   ./scriptname.sh
   ```

> 💡 **Tip:** Make sure you have Bash installed and proper permissions to execute scripts.
